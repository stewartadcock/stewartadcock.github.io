I made a thing.

Two thoughts had been swirling around my head for a while…

1. There are a lot of people out there who need yoga in their lives - whether that’s for physical or mental reasons (or just for fun!)
2. I was annoyed at the technical challenge, and even more annoyed at the costs, when I looked for options to share videos with a wider audience.

I was in a position where if anyone could fix those two problems, it was me.  So I did.

# For Students

Movement Prescription is a video platform that gives you everything from quick, effective exercises you can do right at your desk to combat 
the effects of prolonged sitting, through to complete yoga programmes with full-length classes. Suitable for all levels, and covers numerous 
styles. Start your journey to better health, less pain, and more energy.

- Wake up more refreshed

# For Teachers and Content Creators

My plan is to host content under one of three models for teachers.

A Free Showcase: using the platform to host and share content and direct our audience to the teacher’s classes, website, app, workshops or retreats. No obligations or restrictions!

Premium Content: monetise content through a simple, transparent revenue-sharing model on Movement Prescription, based on Premium Subscriptions. This will be simple and pain-free.

Single-time Sales: host content behind a paywall, pricing at the teacher’s discretion and handled through the platform.

- **Kajabi**: $179/month on the Basic Plan
- **Uscreen**: $149/month + $1.99 per subscriber on the cheapest Plan
- **HeyMarvelous**: $125/month on the Solo Plan
- **Teachable**: $89/month on the cheapest Plan
- **Movement Prescription**: _No setup fees or monthly charges for teachers. Ever._
