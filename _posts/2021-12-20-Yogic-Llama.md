I have no idea whether you practice yoga.  I'm pretty sure you have some interest 
in your physical and mental well-being though.  There is a good chance that you are 
a programmer or software engineer if you find yourself reading this. Putting those 
things together suggests to me that you may be interested in an something that is 
live in the near future.

Yoga for Software Engineers.  Yep, you read that right.

As software engineers we spend too long sitting at our desks, hunched over our 
keyboards and gazing at our glowing screens.  That's not good for either our bodies 
or our brains - and we know it.

This is the cause of poor posture, sore backs, strained eyes, social anxiety, aching 
wrists, but we are doing what we love in creating fantastic software. What if there 
was a simple and fun way to reverse the effects of our desk-bound lifestyles?

Let me introduce yoga for software engineers, which guides you through some simple 
practices designed specifically for people like you and me to live a more healthy 
and fulfilling life!
